FMDisplay widget for EdgeTX
===========================

Download and extract the FMDisplay.zip file and copy the contents to the transmitters SD card to /WIDGETS/FMDisplay

This widget reads the current radio Flight Mode and displays it on the screen in larger print with different background colors.

To change text size or mode background colors, manually edit the main.lua script.

This was designed and tested on the TX16S. May work on other color radios but currently untested.
